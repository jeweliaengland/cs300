What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I was asked to craete data structures to print course information for a college.
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by doing each data structure in a different week as the course was set up that way. This helped me understand the differences in each structure. Data structures are important to understand because they are used in everyday life and in almost all softeare systems to store information. 
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
When I would cone aross a place that I would get stuck or confused, I would step away and come back with a fresh mind.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The work on this project gave me a much deepewr understanding on data structures and how they work with an overall program. 
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I was able to work on this project in a way that the code could be updated and maintained if need be. I also ensured that I used plenty of comments to understand this project if I were to come back to it in the future.
